This repo contains my solution to Pluralsight's takehome project. 

The solution consists of a Random Forrest classifier trained on the data in `data/recruiting_zeta-disease_training-data_take-home-challenge.csv`, and used to make testing predictions based on the data in  `data/recruiting_zeta-disease_prediction-data_take-home-challenge.csv`.

The resulting predictions are in `predictions.csv`. Model development and data exploration are in `solution.ipynb`.
